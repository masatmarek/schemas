The FIXM Core v3.0.1 was released on February 11, 2015.This is a maintenance release for the v3.0 model, schemas, and documentation. The purpose of this release is to qualify the XSD schemas, by enabling the attribute elementFormDefault = "qualified" for every schema file. The change is limited to the XSD schemas, all supporting documentation remains the same.


NOTE: In support of ICAO FF-ICE, the content of the FIXM v3.0 schemas
reflects the continuous progress and evolution under discussion. 
Global convergence is expected to be achieved in FIXM 4.0.
